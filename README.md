# LUAD
This is an automatic identification of LUAD pathological slides based on CNN
Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer, comprising around 40% of all lung cancer cases. It is very important to diagnose as early as possible. In this report, we built different models for prediction of mortality and compared their performance. We used Pytorch to build a neural network for classification of pathological images from TCGA, used R to perform logistic regression, random forest, and survival analyses to predict clinical data. Through the combination of several models, the accuracy of prediction has reached a relatively good level of about 80%.
